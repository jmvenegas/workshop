# Readme for ArduinoGamepadSimple Project
#	Most of this information can be inferred from the code

# Notes:
	A. Buttons are wired between digital pin & down. We use the pullup resistor to tell when button is pushed. 
	B. Code assumes the values of potentiometer reads are between 0-1024
	C. All the java code is containted to a single file. Compile and run.

# Configuration
	Arduino Uno R3:
		Joystick XAxis -  Analog Pin  0
		Joystick YAxis -  Analog Pin  1
		Trigger(Button) - Digital Pin 3
		Thumb(Button) -   Digital Pin 4
